# SimpleOpenGL 2D Robot Animation

A simple project demonstrating 2D planar robot animation. The aim of this development is to build a full simulation for a variety of robotics from the ground up using homemade libraries, and visualisation using openGL.

## Features

- Animates a 2-link planar robot arm.

## Work in progress
- Inverse kinematics
- Path planning
- Inertial considerations

### Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
cmake --build .
